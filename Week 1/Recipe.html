    <h1 style="text-align: left; padding: 1px 10px;">What is Japanese Curry ?</h1>
    <p>Japanese curry often consists of a protein, sweet onions, carrots, and potatoes and has a thick, stew-like
      consistency. A roux thickens the sauce (a mixture of fat and flour, and an addition of curry spices). </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: left; padding: 1px 10px;">History of Japanese Curry</h1>
    <p>The British brought curry, which was originally Western-style stews spiced with curry powder, to Japan in the late
      1800s. Soon after the Japanese modified curry to become their own form, "Curry Rice" (Kare Raisu, ) was created. By
      the 1950s, S&B Foods had created an easy-to-use instant mix in block form called curry roux that allowed anyone to
      quickly prepare curry rice at home.</p>
    <p>Curry is now a common cuisine seen in restaurants and food courts of department stores and has become a staple in
      Japanese households. Even outside of Japan, several other Asian nations have adopted it due to its popularity.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: left; padding: 1px 10px;">What Makes Japanese Curry Different from Other Curries</h1>
    <p>Japanese curry differs significantly from most other curries in the globe in that it has a thicker consistency and a
      more sweet and savory flavor profile. Onions, carrots, and other ingredients like honey and apple shredded provide a special sweetness to the dish.</p>
    <p>The sauce has layers of earthy tastes and spices, like a rich, thick demi-glace. Japanese curry is sometimes
      compared to a hearty stew rather than a traditional curry like Thai or Indian curry. Children can eat it because it
      is considerably less spicy.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: left; padding: 1px 10px;">8 Helpful Tips to Make Japanese Chicken Curry</h1>
    <h2>
      <input type="checkbox">
      Tip #1: Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>Onions</li>
      <li>Carrots</li>
      <li>Potatoes</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      <input type="checkbox">
      Tip #2: Cook the onion till tender and golden</h2>
    <p>The nicely browned onions add a ton of flavor to the final curry. If you have an additional 5-10 minutes,
      caramelize the onion.</p>
    <h2>
      <input type="checkbox">
      Tip #3: Cover the ingredients with just enough broth (or water)</h2>
    <p>When you add the broth/water, be sure the ingredients are covered with just enough water, and not submerged
      completely. As you simmer, the ingredients will release more moisture to the cooking liquid.</p>
    <h2>
      <input type="checkbox">
      Tip #4: Do not forget to skim</h2>
    <p>Skimming is a very important step in Japanese cooking. We skim the scum and impurities to achieve a refined
      taste.<br>
      <br>
      Get a fine mesh skimmer and fill up the measuring cup with water. Skim the impurities and dunk the skimmer in the
      water to clean. And repeat until the broth is clean.</p>
    <h2>
      <input type="checkbox">
      Tip #5: Add 2 cubes of curry roux at a time</h2>
    <p>Make sure all the curry roux cubes are dissolved completely. You don’t want to end up biting into a chunk of
      curry cube while eating!<br>
      <br>
      Fill up a ladle with broth and add 2 cubes. Using a spoon or chopsticks, let the roux dissolve completely. Then
      add 2 more cubes and repeat.</p>
    <h2>
      <input type="checkbox">
      Tip #6: Watch out when simmering curry</h2>
    <p>Always watch the curry after you add the roux. The thick curry sauce gets burnt easily at the bottom of the pot. </p>
    <li style="margin-left:3%;">Need to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes after adding curry roux.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:3%;">Use low heat to simmer.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:3%;">Stay in the kitchen, and keep stirring!</li>
    <h2>
      <input type="checkbox">
      Tip #7: Make a big batch and store</h2>
    <p>Japanese curry is ideal for freezing. I often cook up a big batch of leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator
      for a few days or in the freezer for up to a month.<br>
      <br>
      Oh, one more thing! Potatoes will change their
      texture after freezing so remove the potatoes if you plan to freeze the curry.</p>
